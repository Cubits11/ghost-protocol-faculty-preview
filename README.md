## TL;DR
Ghost Protocol is a **privacy‑preserving, emotionally intelligent AI framework** that enforces **user‑defined constitutions** in real time. It blends **HCI**, **AI ethics**, and **privacy engineering** to keep interactions emotionally safe and auditable.

- **Fast path:** parse → compile → enforce constraints (target 50–100 ms)
- **Privacy‑first:** tiered storage, redaction, and risk scoring
- **Human‑centered:** value‑sensitive design, “symbolic silence” as a first‑class action
- **Auditability:** every decision yields a reproducible trail

---

## Why this matters (the problem)
Current AI systems optimize for engagement, not well‑being. Users rarely control **how** an AI is allowed to respond, **what** is remembered, or **when** it should **pause**. Privacy settings are opaque; safety policies are static and vendor‑defined.

**Ghost Protocol flips the defaults**: users set the rules, privacy is measured (not assumed), and silence is sometimes the most ethical response.
